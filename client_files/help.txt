Meza1 Help
==========

This help file is greatly under construction.
Apologies for it's uselessness at this stage.

This script allows you to install Meza1, which is
an all-in-one MediaWiki install script targeted
at CentOS/RedHat Linux. The script can install
everything required for MediaWiki from a very
minimal installation of Linux. Primarily this
includes Apache, PHP, MySQL and all the MediaWiki
application. Meza1 focuses on providing a
consistent installation for enterprise use of
MediaWiki, and providing newer extensions like
VisualEditor, Elastic Search, Echo and Flow.
